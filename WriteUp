Bookstore
Introduction
•	First to find some of the information we would need to scan the IP of the Bookstore
•	Then it will show us what ports are running and the website of it.

Website
•	We will visit the website by using the port number .
•	Once we visited the website we can see it is a Rest API meaning we can just look for the API direct in the website.
•	After looking around the Rest API for information we can then explore the actual Bookstore page.
•	The most interesting place to look at the bookstore website would be the login page.
•	We would probably do the inspect tool incase there is anything interesting.

Console
•	So what we found that there is something with the debugger and pin for a console.
•	Means that there probably a problem which will allows us to get the pin for the console.
•	Looking through the assets of the js since one of the message did something about it.
•	In the Js script it says something about the previous API version being vulnerable so we will use that to our advantage.
•	So we would go back to using the IP and port but put the API version to 1 of the bash history instead of the present version.
•	And we would find the debug pin for the console which we will enter into the console pin to gain access.

Import and User
•	Now we have the console for us to access so we need to figure out how to connect our terminal with console on the website
•	Since the console is able to use netcat we can connect it by using netcat listener in the terminal by using port 4444,
•	The terminal commands I used for the Netcat would be on github Payload
•	We now have a copy of shell to be technical reverse shell which allow us to find the User and Root Flag.
•	Though now we just ‘ls’ in the command and use the command ‘cat user.txt’ which will give us the Flag of the User.

Root Flag
•	For the root flag could not grab the flag of it since we need a “Magic Number” to bypass the security.
•	We now probably need to use another program to reverse engineer to find the code
•	Though I was not able to do that because of technical problems with the VPN for Kali and Attackbox was being buggy.
